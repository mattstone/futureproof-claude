### 1. **Intelligent Document Analysis Agent** 🔍
**Priority: HIGH | Impact: TRANSFORMATIVE**

#### Problem Being Solved
Currently, document verification is manual. Agents could autonomously extract, validate, and flag issues with uploaded documents.

#### Implementation
```ruby
# New Model: DocumentAnalysisAgent
class DocumentAnalysisAgent
  def analyze_document(document)
    # Extract text/data from PDFs, images
    extracted_data = extract_document_data(document)

    # Validate against application data
    discrepancies = validate_against_application(extracted_data)

    # Make autonomous decision
    if discrepancies.empty?
      auto_approve_document(document)
      trigger_next_stage_workflow
    else
      create_clarification_request(discrepancies)
      notify_human_if_critical(discrepancies)
    end
  end

  def extract_document_data(document)
    # Integration with Claude/GPT-4 Vision API
    # Extract: ID numbers, addresses, dates, signatures
  end

  def validate_against_application(data)
    # Compare extracted data with Application model
    # Return list of mismatches or missing items
  end
end
```

#### Agent Behaviors
- **Autonomous**: Auto-approves documents that match perfectly

#### Problem Being Solved
Agents don't learn from experience. Each interaction starts from zero knowledge.

#### Implementation
```ruby
# New Model: AgentMemory
class AgentMemory < ApplicationRecord
  # agent_id, memory_type, context, insights, outcome, created_at

  scope :successful_patterns, -> { where(outcome: 'positive') }
  scope :failed_patterns, -> { where(outcome: 'negative') }

  def self.learn_from_application(application)
    # Extract patterns from successful applications
    if application.status_accepted?
      memories = [
        extract_communication_patterns(application),
        extract_timing_patterns(application),
        extract_risk_indicators(application)
      ]

      memories.each { |m| create!(m) }
    end
  end

  def self.recall_similar_situation(context)
    # Find similar past situations and their outcomes
    similar_memories = where(memory_type: context[:type])
                      .where("context::text ILIKE ?", "%#{context[:key_feature]}%")
                      .successful_patterns
                      .limit(5)

    synthesize_insights(similar_memories)
  end
end

# Enhanced AgentLifecycleService
class AgentLifecycleService
  def execute_with_memory!
    # Recall similar situations
    similar_cases = AgentMemory.recall_similar_situation(
      type: 'application_stage',
      key_feature: @entity.key_characteristics
    )

    # Adapt behavior based on memory
    if similar_cases[:success_pattern] == :early_engagement
      prioritize_early_communication
    elsif similar_cases[:success_pattern] == :detailed_explanation
      prioritize_educational_content
    end

    # Execute and record outcome
    result = execute!
    AgentMemory.record_outcome(@agent, @entity, result)
  end
end
```

#### Agent Behaviors
- **Autonomous**: Self-improves without manual configuration changes
- **Adaptive**: Applies lessons from past successes/failures

#### Problem Being Solved
Agents work in isolation. They could collaborate to solve complex problems.

#### Implementation
```ruby
# New Service: AgentCoordinationService
class AgentCoordinationService
  def handle_complex_query(application, query)
    # Decompose query into sub-tasks
    tasks = decompose_query(query)

    # Assign to appropriate agents
    assignments = {
      financial_calculation: AiAgent.find_by(name: 'Motoko'),
      document_verification: AiAgent.find_by(name: 'Rei'),
      contract_implications: AiAgent.find_by(name: 'Yumi')
    }

    # Execute in parallel
    results = tasks.map do |task_type, task_details|
      agent = assignments[task_type]
      agent.execute_task(task_details, application)
    end

    # Synthesize comprehensive response
    synthesized_response = synthesize_multi_agent_response(results)
    send_unified_response(application, synthesized_response)
  end

  def escalate_to_agent_team(application, issue)
    # Create agent "war room" for complex cases
    team = assemble_agent_team(issue)

    # Agents discuss and decide
    resolution = agent_team_discussion(team, issue, application)

    execute_team_resolution(resolution)
  end
end
```

#### Agent Behaviors
- **Collaborative**: Agents consult each other
- **Specialized**: Each agent contributes their expertise
- **Consensus**: Agents reach agreement on complex decisions
- **Escalating**: Team formation for difficult cases

---

## 🎨 Design Patterns for Agentic AI

### Pattern 1: Observe → Decide → Act → Learn
```ruby
class AgenticPattern
  def execute(context)
    # OBSERVE: Gather information
    observations = observe_environment(context)

    # DECIDE: Make autonomous decision
    decision = make_decision(observations)

    # ACT: Execute decision
    result = execute_action(decision)

    # LEARN: Record outcome for future improvement
    learn_from_outcome(observations, decision, result)
  end
end
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Autonomy
```ruby
class ProgressiveAutonomy
  def handle_task(task, confidence)
    if confidence > 0.9
      execute_autonomously(task)
    elsif confidence > 0.7
      execute_with_notification(task)
    else
      request_human_approval(task)
    end

    # Increase confidence over time
    adjust_confidence_based_on_outcome(task)
  end
end
```

### Pattern 3: Graceful Degradation
```ruby
class GracefulDegradation
  def attempt_task(task)
    try_autonomous_solution(task)
  rescue AgentUncertaintyError
    try_template_based_solution(task)
  rescue TemplateMissingError
    escalate_to_human(task)
  end
end
```

end
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Implement First)

### 1. Smart Message Replies (1-2 days)
Replace template selection with Claude-generated contextual responses:
```ruby
# In ApplicationMessage
def generate_smart_reply(customer_message)
  context = {
    application: application.as_json,
    previous_messages: thread_messages.last(5),
    agent_personality: ai_agent.communication_style,
    customer_sentiment: analyze_sentiment(customer_message)
  }

  ClaudeApiService.generate_response(
    "Respond to customer inquiry",
    context
  )
end
```

### 2. Risk-Based Routing (2-3 days)
Auto-route applications based on simple risk scoring:
```ruby
# In Application model (after_create)
def auto_route_based_on_risk
  risk_score = RiskAssessmentAgent.quick_score(self)

  if risk_score > 0.7
    add_to_high_risk_queue
    assign_senior_reviewer
  else
    standard_processing_flow
  end
end
```

### 3. Abandoned Application Detection (1 day)
Proactive nudges for stuck applications:
```ruby
# New job: DetectAbandonedApplicationsJob (runs hourly)
Application.where(status: [:created, :property_details])
           .where("updated_at < ?", 24.hours.ago)
           .each do |app|
  ProactiveMonitoringAgent.send_nudge(app)
end
```

---

## 🔒 Safety & Governance

### Human-in-the-Loop Gates
- **High-risk decisions**: Always require human approval
- **Legal/compliance**: Human review mandatory
- **High-value contracts**: Human verification required
- **Customer complaints**: Escalate to human immediately

### Agent Confidence Thresholds
```ruby
AUTONOMY_RULES = {
  document_approval: { threshold: 0.95 },
  risk_routing: { threshold: 0.85 },
  message_response: { threshold: 0.90 },
  issue_resolution: { threshold: 0.80 }
}
```

### Audit Trail
Every agent decision logged:
- What decision was made
- Based on what data
- Confidence score
- Outcome (success/failure)
- Human override if applicable

### Explainability
Agents must explain their reasoning:
```ruby
class AgentDecision
  def explanation
    "I routed this application to high-risk queue because:
     - LTV ratio is #{ltv_ratio} (threshold: 80%)
     - Property valuation variance is #{variance}% (threshold: 10%)
     - Applicant age is #{age} (higher risk above 75)
     - Confidence: #{confidence}%"
  end
end
```
