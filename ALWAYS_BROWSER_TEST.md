# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER: ALWAYS BROWSER TEST YOUR WORK ðŸš¨

## MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS:

### BEFORE CLAIMING ANY WORK IS "COMPLETE" OR "FINISHED":

1. **BROWSER TEST THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY**
   - Open the page in a real browser
   - Test the actual user workflow
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

2. **NEVER ASSUME CODE WORKS WITHOUT TESTING**
   - Code that looks correct â‰  Code that works
   - Models, views, controllers all need real testing
   - Database queries and method calls must be verified

3. **COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:**
   - Undefined method errors (missing model methods)
   - Template rendering errors
   - JavaScript functionality
   - CSS styling and layout
   - Form submissions and validations

### FAILURE RATE TRACKING:
- Current failure rate when claiming "finished": ~50%
- This is unacceptable and must improve to 0%

### THE RULE:
**If you haven't browser tested it, you haven't finished it.**

## This file serves as a permanent reminder to always test work before claiming completion.
