    <p>Real time company announcements are freely available on our site for investors' private and personal use. A
        distinction is drawn however where use is for a 'commercial' as opposed to 'private or personal' purpose. Should

        <li>You are seeking to access and use the information other than for private or personal investment purposes.
        </li>
        <li>You are seeking to access and use the information in connection with any trade or business.</li>
        <li>You are engaged in the business of accessing or aggregating information and redistributing or otherwise
            furnishing that information to third parties.
        </li>
        <li>You are a member or participating organisation of an exchange or an approved representative or other
            employee of such an organisation accessing and using the information in connection with your employment, or
            any associated person of the foregoing.
        </li>
        <li>You are employed by a bank, insurance company, fund or asset manager or other organisation to perform

        </li>
    </ul>
